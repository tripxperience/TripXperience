## Overview
### Description
The app will allow the user to save information on places they have been, and/or would like to go in the future.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Travel / Social / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Mobile App only / Mobile first experience
- **Story:** Allows users to write a journal about their trips in text and pictures.
- **Market:** Users can list the places they wish to travel to, and add information about the places they've traveled to.
- **Habit:** Users can share their trips at any given time of the day, (optional) as well as see other people's trips and suggestions of points of interest.
- **Scope:** First we will start with people using this as a personal travel journal, adding things that they liked or want to go back to in the future. Yet, as an optional for the team, we can make this public/sharing platform.
